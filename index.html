      <p>
        Last year I decided to go for a summer holiday with my brother to Rome in
        Italy. We wanted to visit a city and feel not like tourists but rather
        like locals who wanted to experience everyday life there. But of course,
        we also wanted to see few of landmarks, enchanting places, locations that
        we will remember. There was one problem. We hate guidebooks and planning
        holidays. We decided to do something with it.

        We came into something that we called Echotags. We are builiding a service
        that helps people who like to travel. Something where anybody can record
        their own geo-localised audio files with a description of the place.
        Anybody can listen to those files once approaches their geo-coordinates.
        The trick is to do it completely hands-free. Your phone will be all time
        in your pocket.
