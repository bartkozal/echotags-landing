        | Feeling lost and completely independent in a new city is great. Using
          Echotags, you will get tailor-made information just for you, exactly
          when it is useful. Our application uses geolocation to play you recorded
          messages via your earbuds when you are close to an interesting object,
          spot or location. You can download handmade sets, prepared by humans,
          in advance and then use them during your trip. Everything takes place
          offline, so you don't need to worry about your data plan.

      p
        | Echotags is not only about new places. Rediscover your surroundings
          using the experiences of different people. You can play, save, record,
          and share your audio tags with the whole world. Possibilities are almost
          unlimited. Guidebooks, recommendations, voice journals, city exploring
          games, re-emerging trips or leaving a message on the spot are just
          a few examples. You can make them private, share with others for free
          or sell them.

        | Why are we doing this?
      p
        | Traveling is one of the most exciting human activities. We are travelers
          too. We love to enjoy new places, explore cities, checking out where
          the best food is or the most beautiful landmarks are. But there is one
          major drawback which we personally hate; once you go to a new spot,
          you usually buy a guidebook, check the Internet in advance or go to
          a tourist information center. The problem is that you then have to
          carry all those unhandy guidebooks. When you need them the most,
          they are always inside a bag or a rucksack. Constantly checking out phones
          or tablets is not a super convenient option either. You would just like to
          experience new places, without any disturbances, wouldn't you?
      p
        | We make Echotags to deliver you audio insights, created by other
          passionate people, which you can listen to during your trips. You can
          freely choose topics that are interesting for you, and start enjoying
          new places, hands-free, in a completely new way.
