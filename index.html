<h1>Discover new favorite places hands-free</h1>

<h2>An innovative way to travel</h2>

<p>
  Feeling lost and completely independent in a new city is great. Using
  Echotags, you will get tailor-made information just for you, exactly
  when it is useful. Our application uses geolocation to play you recorded
  messages via your earbuds when you are close to an interesting object,
  spot or location. You can download handmade sets, prepared by humans,
  in advance and then use them during your trip. Everything takes place
  offline, so you don't need to worry about your data plan.

<h2>Share tidbits about your favorite spots</h2>
<p>
  Echotags is not only about new places. Rediscover your surroundings
  using the experiences of different people. You can play, save, record,
  and share your audio tags with the whole world. Possibilities are almost
  unlimited. Guidebooks, recommendations, voice journals, city exploring
  games, re-emerging trips or leaving a message on the spot are just
  a few examples. You can make them private, share with others for free
  or sell them.

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>
  Traveling is one of the most exciting human activities. We are travelers
  too. We love to enjoy new places, explore cities, checking out where
  the best food is or the most beautiful landmarks are. But there is one
  major drawback which we personally hate; once you go to a new spot,
  you usually buy a guidebook, check the Internet in advance or go to
  a tourist information center. The problem is that you then have to
  carry all those unhandy guidebooks. When you need them the most,
  they are always inside a bag or a rucksack. Constantly checking out phones
  or tablets is not a super convenient option either. You would just like to
  experience new places, without any disturbances, wouldn't you?
</p>

<p>
  We make Echotags to deliver you audio insights, created by other
  passionate people, which you can listen to during your trips. You can
  freely choose topics that are interesting for you, and start enjoying
  new places, hands-free, in a completely new way.
